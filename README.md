# Five-Bit-Adder

# EE SEM 1 PROJECT

The aim of the project is to construct the digital circuit of a 5 bit full adder using logic gates.

Here is a brief idea about Binary adders. Mainly there are two types of Adder: Half Adder and Full Adder. In half adder we can add 2-bit binary numbers but we cant add carry bit in half adder along with the two binary numbers. But in Full Adder Circuit we can add carry in bit along with the two binary numbers.
