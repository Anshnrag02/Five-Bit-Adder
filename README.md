# Five-Bit-Adder

# EE SEM 1 PROJECT

The aim of the project is to construct the digital circuit of a 5 bit full adder using logic gates.

Here is a brief idea about Binary adders. Mainly there are two types of Adder: Half Adder and Full Adder. In half adder we can add 2-bit binary numbers but we cant add carry bit in half adder along with the two binary numbers. But in Full Adder Circuit we can add carry in bit along with the two binary numbers. We can also add multiple bits binary numbers by cascading the full adder circuits.

# Full Adder Circuit:
So we know that Half-adder circuit has a major drawback that we do not have the scope to provide ‘Carry in’ bit for addition. In case full adder construction, we can actually make a carry in input in the circuitry and could add it with other two inputs A and B. So, in the case of Full Adder Circuit we have three inputs A, B and Carry In and we will get final output SUM and Carry out. So, A + B + CARRY IN = SUM and CARRY OUT.
